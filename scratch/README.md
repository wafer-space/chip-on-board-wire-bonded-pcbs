## !!Warning: Still WIP!!

## History

Over the past few weeks we have been considering a number of different designs. 

There are some projects that require a high pin count. In an effort to keep prices down and use components that are widely available the 
current highest choice option seems to be an LGA (Land Grid Array). The current version has 100 user pins--even though the default pad frame will contain only 73 wire bonds
this will enable extra ground and power pads for analog and other signals that benefit from close proximity.

Was considered a pain and discarded

### Castellated pins

Shares many of the drawbacks of LGA with less pins

### Mezzanine Connector

Only connectors up to 50p had high availability. Some projects demand more.

### 2x Mezzanine

Worries over positional tolerances with multiple connectors

### DIP

Some projects want this, but has low pin count. Some hybrid castellated versions have also been considered.
